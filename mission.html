                TREAT was started as a simple project by Kuber Mehta when he was tired of seeing triggering content on TV while having food, which often ruined his appetite. This project began as part of his CS50 coursework and has since grown into something much bigger.

                TREAT envisions a future where people are empowered with AI to know what they are watching and take control back into their hands. Our mission is to make content consumption safer and more enjoyable for everyone by providing tools that help identify potentially triggering content.
